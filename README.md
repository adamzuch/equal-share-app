# equal share

A web app for splitting group expenses and settling debts.

equal share was created to address a real-world need for a minimal and intuitive expense splitting app which doesnâ€™t require the user to log in or download.

Users can add expenses, see a clear breakdown, and share results with a simple hyperlink (for free!).
