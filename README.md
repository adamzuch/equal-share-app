# equal share

A web app for splitting group expenses and settling debts. Live now at [equalshare.me](https://equalshare.me).

## Why?

Calculating who owes who for shared expenses is tedious (and hard) — **equal share does it for you, easily.**

Signing up, logging in, or downloading an app is tedious (your friends won't do it) — **equal share is online. Share results via hyperlink.**

Paying for a service sucks — **equal share is free :)**
